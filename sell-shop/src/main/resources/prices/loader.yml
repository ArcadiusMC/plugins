# Controls what price files are loaded and for what purpose.
# Any price files loaded are accessible in the sellshop pages
# like so:
# - slot: 1,1
#   sell: <price map name>:<material>
#
# Example:
# - slot: 1,1
#   sell: example:quartz
#

#
# Example entry explaining formatting options
#
# Values:
# - file (Required):
#     Name of the file to load the full prices from
#     (File type not needed)
# - global (Optional, defaults to false):
#     Determines if the prices specified in this entry
#     are used globally. This means (most of the time)
#     That the prices in the file are used in the generic
#     /shop, accessible to all, and when calculating
#     earnings from auto sold items.

  file: "file/path"
