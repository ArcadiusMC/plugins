#
# Offset at which market templates are, relative to the market's
# current position.
#
# The x,y,z coordinates are added onto the market's origin
# coordinates. (When doing '/rg info', the origin coordinates
# are the first coordinates that appear in the 'Bounds:' field
#
# Thus, to find the template position of a market do:
# reset-position = shop-origin + template-offset
#
# Values:
# - world (Optional, uses the world each market is in if not set):
#     Specifies the world the templates are copied from,
#     Default:  (Empty)
#
# - x: X offset
# - y: Y offset
# - z: Z offset
#
template-offset:
  world: "world"
  x: 0
  y: 0
  z: 0

#
# Allows setting different offsets for each market group
#
# Follows same logic as the above-mentioned 'template-offset'
#
per-group-offsets:
  example_group:
    world: "world"
    x: 0
    y: 0
    z: 0

#
# Whether to copy a market when it is claimed to its template area
# or not.
#
# If set to true, then everytime a market is copied, a copy of it
# is pasted at the area specified by 'template-offset'
#
# If set to false, the area at the 'template-offset' is treated as
# a read-only structure that will only be used when resetting
#
copy-on-claim: false
