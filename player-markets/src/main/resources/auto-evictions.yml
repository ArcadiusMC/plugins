# Base aggression value (0..1)
#
# The eviction system uses a simple concept of "aggression", the
# idea is that as more shops become occupied, the more aggressive
# the system becomes in trying to keep markets open in each region.
#
# Since changing the base values of each criterion is unfair to
# players (Shifting rules are harder to follow), then the only
# variable in play is which rules are enforced and not what qualifies
# under those rules.
#
# If this system turns out to be terrible, this base value can always
# be set to a flat 1 or the threshold of each criterion lowered to 0.
#
#
# Aggression formula:
# aggression = base-aggression + ((owned_shops / total_shops) * aggression-multiplier)
