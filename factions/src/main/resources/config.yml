# Note on Sell shop multipliers:
#
# Sell shop multipliers are interpolated based on a player's
# reputation from min reputation to max reputation.
#
# Meaning, a player with 0 reputation (min-rep=-100 and
# max-rep=100) is considered to be halfway between the min
# and max multipliers (For example min-multiplier=1,
# max-multiplier=2, the player's multiplier at 0 reputation
# would be 1.5)
#
# If a player is not currently a member of a merchant's
# faction or has never been a member of a merchant's
# faction, then the starting-reputation is used.
#
# Also for a multiplier to work, a sell shop page must be
# tagged with the "faction:<faction name>" tag. For more info
# see the example.yml page file in sell shops.
#
