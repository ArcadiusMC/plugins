# ------------------------------------------------------------
# _style:
# Sets the style used by all messages in the section
#
# Styles in subsections are merged with parent styles,
# subsection style overrides parent style for each
# conflicting value
#
# Examples:
# _style: "gray"
#   Makes each message in the section have gray text by default
#
# _style: "gray;italic;bold"
#   Gray, bold and italic text
#
# _style: "red;!italic"
#   Red text with Italic text explicitly disabled
#
# _style: ";italic"
#   Unset color with Italic text
#
# ------------------------------------------------------------
# _styles:
# Defines style variables, not usable outside the file itself,
#
# Syntax is the same as '_style'
#
# Use variables with: _style: $<name>
#
# Example:
# _style: $normal
# _style: $err
