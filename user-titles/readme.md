# User Titles

Player ranks, tiers and titles plugin.
  
User titles are name prefixes that players can optionally choose from. Access
to certain titles can be locked from players without permissions. This is because
title ownership is determined by permissions.  
  
Each title has a permission that determines if a player is able to use that title.
